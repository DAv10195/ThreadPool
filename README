As part of the Operating Systems course I took during my 2nd year at Bar Ilan University, I was asked to implement a thread pool
in C using POSIX threads for Unix/Linux.

An implementation of a queue is also included, and two tests (with a main function running them) are included:

test1 and an info file about it

test2 which is simpler than test1

a makefile (targets: compile1 - compile with test1, compile2 - compile with test2, run - run the last compiled version)
is also included.
